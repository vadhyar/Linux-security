Crontab : crontab is nothing but a event scheduler which is native to linux which can be leveraged to execute the tasks on a specific date or a day in a week/month.
Not only this, but also it can be used to schedule the frequency of the tasks to get executed.
ps -ef  check the process in linux
crontab -l list the crontab basics for the specific user
The output of the crontab will be displayed in the below format:
           Minutes Hours dom(date of the month) month dow(day of the week) command
Examples:
      a) Create a cron job to delete all log files from the home directory 
          let us consider deleting the files in our home directory for every one minute , the cron file looks something like the below one
            */01 * * * * rm -rf /home/vadhyar/*.log
      b) Create a cron job to create a text file in /tmp/routine.log and write current timestamp to it every 2 minutes.
            */02 * * * * date >> /tmp/routine.log
            
      c) Create a cron job to add /tmp/routine.log to .tar archive, move this archive to /home/student/ and delete the original 
         log file after every 10 minutes.
         
         for the above thing lets write  all the command seperated by "&" or else a bash script can be written , let me show the both ways
         
          a) command seperated by "&"
          
            */10 * * * * cd && tar -cvf archive.tar --absolute-names /tmp/routine.log && rm /tmp/routine.log
            
           b) Bash script 
               
               #!/bin/bash
                cd && tar -cvf archive.tar --absolute-names /tmp/routine.log && rm /tmp/routine.log
                
            */10 * * * * ./script.sh
